> 🎮 **[Live Demo: Play the Simulation](https://sambhav-gautam.github.io/selfgrowing/)**

An autonomous, self-growing miniature world where AI agents live, age, form relationships, and shape history. Watch the 3D diorama populate and evolve procedurally.

You can copy and paste the following text into the **About** section of your GitHub repository (click the ⚙️ icon on the right side of the repo):
> *A 3D autonomous miniature world simulation where AI agents live, age, and form complex relationships. Built with React Three Fiber.*

## 🌟 Features
- **Procedural Town Planning**: A massive 200x200 grid featuring winding rivers, dense forests, and distinct residential and commercial zones.
- **Advanced Architecture**: Highly detailed, toy-like 3D models including Hospitals, Government buildings, Parks, and Mansions.
- **Social Graph Simulation**: Agents form complex relationships (Friendship, Hate, Family) and track their needs (food, safety, rest).
- **Stunning Render Pipeline**: Powered by React Three Fiber with bloom post-processing, soft shadows, and a beautiful UI glassmorphism HUD.
- **Persistent State**: History is saved to JSON and committed back to the repo automatically via GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Setup & Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Run Headless Simulation**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/run-simulation.ts
   ```

## 🤖 Automation (CI/CD)
The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment and logic tracking:
- **`deploy.yml`**: Automatically builds the Vite app and drops the bundled static site fully intact onto the GitHub Pages environment.
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/simulate.yml` runs the simulation securely in the background.
- Manual Trigger: You can manually trigger the simulation from the "Actions" tab in GitHub.
