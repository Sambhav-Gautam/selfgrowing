## Overview
A "self-growing" autonomous world simulation where AI agents live, age, form relationships, and shape history. The simulation runs headlessly via GitHub Actions and visualizes the history in a React frontend.

## Features
- **Social Graph**: Complex relationships (Friendship, Hate, Family).
- **Institutions**: Power structures and roles (e.g., Kings, Leaders).
- **Autonomous Simulation**: Runs on a schedule via GitHub Actions.
- **Persistent State**: History is saved to JSON and committed back to the repo.
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive Three.js map of the world.

## Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Run Headless Simulation**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/run-simulation.ts
   ```

## Automation
The project uses GitHub Actions to run the simulation every 6 hours.
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/simulate.yml`
- Manual Trigger: You can manually trigger the simulation from the "Actions" tab in GitHub.
